A chat app I built with react and randomAPI. I used this project to gain some practice with react and API conections.

Main functionalities include:
- State management with react hooks and context.
- Navigation with react router.
- Fully responsive design and styling with SASS.
- Auth with Google account through Firebase.
- User is able to hold many chat rooms in simultaneous and add new chat rooms with other users.
- New users are provided through a conection with randomAPI.
